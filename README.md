## Developer

Hi, 

My name is Nico and I am the developer of this node.
I am an independent consultant and I really like open source software.


My nodes are free to use for everyone, but please consider [donating](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nicokowalc5) when you use my nodes.
This helps me to build and maintain nodes for everyone to use.

Also, if you are looking for some outside help with n8n, I can of course also offer my services.
* Node Development

Please contact me kontakt@nicokowalczyk.de if you want to make use of my services.

For questions or issues with nodes, please open an issue on Github.
